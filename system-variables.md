# The System Variables

The system variables in MySQL are the system parameters that modify the operation of the database runtime. These variables have two types of scope, Global Scope and Session Scope. TiDB supports all the system variables in MySQL 5.7. Most of the variables are only supported for compatibility and do not affect the runtime behaviors.

## Set the system variables

You can use the [`SET`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-set-variable.md) statement to change the value of the system variables. Before you change, consider the scope of the variable. For more information, see [MySQL Dynamic System Variables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/dynamic-system-variables.html).

### Set Global variables

Add the `GLOBAL` keyword before the variable or use `@@global.` as the modifier:

```sql
SET GLOBAL autocommit = 1;
SET @@global.autocommit = 1;
```

> **Note:**
>
<<<<<<< HEAD
> In a distributed TiDB database, a variable's `GLOBAL` setting is persisted to the storage layer. A single TiDB instance proactively gets the `GLOBAL` information and forms `gvc` (global variables cache) every 2 seconds. The cache information remains valid within 2 seconds. When you set the `GLOBAL` variable, to ensure the effectiveness of new sessions, make sure that the interval between two operations is larger than 2 seconds. For details, see [Issue #14531](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/14531).
=======
> Unlike in MySQL, the `max_execution_time` system variable currently works on all kinds of statements in TiDB, not only restricted to the `SELECT` statement. The precision of the timeout value is roughly 100ms. This means the statement might not be terminated in accurate milliseconds as you specify.

### port

- Scope: NONE
- Default value: 4000
- The port that the `tidb-server` is listening on when speaking the MySQL protocol.

### socket

- Scope: NONE
- Default value: ''
- The local unix socket file that the `tidb-server` is listening on when speaking the MySQL protocol.

### sql_mode

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY,STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION`
- This variable controls a number of MySQL compatibility behaviors. See [SQL Mode](/sql-mode.md) for more information.

### sql_select_limit <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0.2 version</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: `2^64 - 1` (18446744073709551615)
- The maximum number of rows returned by the `SELECT` statements.

### system_time_zone

- Scope: NONE
- Default value: (system dependent)
- This variable shows the system time zone from when TiDB was first bootstrapped. See also [`time_zone`](#time_zone).

### tidb_allow_batch_cop <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0 version</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 1
- This variable is used to control how TiDB sends a coprocessor request to TiFlash. It has the following values:

    * `0`: Never send requests in batches
    * `1`: Aggregation and join requests are sent in batches
    * `2`: All coprocessor requests are sent in batches

### tidb_allow_remove_auto_inc <span class="version-mark">New in v2.1.18 and v3.0.4</span>

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to set whether the `AUTO_INCREMENT` property of a column is allowed to be removed by executing `ALTER TABLE MODIFY` or `ALTER TABLE CHANGE` statements. It is not allowed by default.

### tidb_auto_analyze_end_time

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 23:59 +0000
- This variable is used to restrict the time window that the automatic update of statistics is permitted. For example, to only allow automatic statistics updates between 1AM and 3AM, set `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time='01:00 +0000'` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time='03:00 +0000'`.

### tidb_auto_analyze_ratio

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 0.5
- This variable is used to set the threshold when TiDB automatically executes [`ANALYZE TABLE`](/sql-statements/sql-statement-analyze-table.md) in a background thread to update table statistics. For example, a value of 0.5 means that auto-analyze is triggered when greater than 50% of the rows in a table have been modified. Auto-analyze can be restricted to only execute during certain hours of the day by specifying `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time`.

> **Note:**
>
> Only when the `run-auto-analyze` option is enabled in the starting configuration file of TiDB, the `auto_analyze` feature can be triggered.

### tidb_auto_analyze_start_time

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 00:00 +0000
- This variable is used to restrict the time window that the automatic update of statistics is permitted. For example, to only allow automatic statistics updates between 1AM and 3AM, set `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time='01:00 +0000'` and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time='03:00 +0000'`.

### tidb_backoff_lock_fast

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 100
- This variable is used to set the `backoff` time when the read request meets a lock.

### tidb_backoff_weight

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 2
- This variable is used to increase the weight of the maximum time of TiDB `backoff`, that is, the maximum retry time for sending a retry request when an internal network or other component (TiKV, PD) failure is encountered. This variable can be used to adjust the maximum retry time and the minimum value is 1.

    For example, the base timeout for TiDB to take TSO from PD is 15 seconds. When `tidb_backoff_weight = 2`, the maximum timeout for taking TSO is: *base time \* 2 = 30 seconds*.

    In the case of a poor network environment, appropriately increasing the value of this variable can effectively alleviate error reporting to the application end caused by timeout. If the application end wants to receive the error information more quickly, minimize the value of this variable.

### tidb_build_stats_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of executing the `ANALYZE` statement.
- When the variable is set to a larger value, the execution performance of other queries is affected.

### tidb_capture_plan_baselines <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the [baseline capturing](/sql-plan-management.md#baseline-capturing) feature. This feature depends on the statement summary, so you need to enable the statement summary before you use baseline capturing.
- After this feature is enabled, the historical SQL statements in the statement summary are traversed periodically, and bindings are automatically created for SQL statements that appear at least twice.

### tidb_check_mb4_value_in_utf8

- Scope: INSTANCE
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to enforce that the `utf8` character set only stores values from the [Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_\(Unicode\)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane). To store characters outside the BMP, it is recommended to use the `utf8mb4` character set.
- You might need to disable this option when upgrading your cluster from an earlier version of TiDB where the `utf8` checking was more relaxed. For details, see [FAQs After Upgrade](/faq/upgrade-faq.md).

### tidb_checksum_table_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the scan index concurrency of executing the `ADMIN CHECKSUM TABLE` statement.
- When the variable is set to a larger value, the execution performance of other queries is affected.

### tidb_config

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: ""
- This variable is read-only. It is used to obtain the configuration information of the current TiDB server.

### tidb_constraint_check_in_place

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This setting only applies to optimistic transactions. When this variable is set to `OFF`, checking for duplicate values in UNIQUE indexes is deferred until the transaction commits. This helps improve performance, but might be an unexpected behavior for some applications. See [Constraints](/constraints.md) for details.

    - When set to zero and using optimistic transactions:

        ```sql
        tidb> create table t (i int key);
        tidb> insert into t values (1);
        tidb> begin optimistic;
        tidb> insert into t values (1);
        Query OK, 1 row affected
        tidb> commit; -- Check only when a transaction is committed.
        ERROR 1062 : Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
        ```

    - When set to 1 and using optimistic transactions:

        ```sql
        tidb> set @@tidb_constraint_check_in_place=1;
        tidb> begin optimistic;
        tidb> insert into t values (1);
        ERROR 1062 : Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
        ```

Constraint checking is always performed in place for pessimistic transactions (default).

### tidb_current_ts

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: 0
- This variable is read-only. It is used to obtain the timestamp of the current transaction.

### tidb_ddl_error_count_limit

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 512
- This variable is used to set the number of retries when the DDL operation fails. When the number of retries exceeds the parameter value, the wrong DDL operation is canceled.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 256
- This variable is used to set the batch size during the `re-organize` phase of the DDL operation. For example, when TiDB executes the `ADD INDEX` operation, the index data needs to backfilled by `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` (the number) concurrent workers. Each worker backfills the index data in batches.
    - If many updating operations such as `UPDATE` and `REPLACE` exist during the `ADD INDEX` operation, a larger batch size indicates a larger probability of transaction conflicts. In this case, you need to adjust the batch size to a smaller value. The minimum value is 32.
    - If the transaction conflict does not exist, you can set the batch size to a large value. The maximum value is 10240. This can increase the speed of the backfilling data, but the write pressure on TiKV also becomes higher.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_priority

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: `PRIORITY_LOW`
- This variable is used to set the priority of executing the `ADD INDEX` operation in the `re-organize` phase.
- You can set the value of this variable to `PRIORITY_LOW`, `PRIORITY_NORMAL` or `PRIORITY_HIGH`.

### tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 4
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of the DDL operation in the `re-organize` phase.

### tidb_disable_txn_auto_retry

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to set whether to disable the automatic retry of explicit transactions. The default value of `ON` means that transactions will not automatically retry in TiDB and `COMMIT` statements might return errors that need to be handled in the application layer.

    Setting the value to `OFF` means that TiDB will automatically retry transactions, resulting in fewer errors from `COMMIT` statements. Be careful when making this change, because it might result in lost updates.

    This variable does not affect automatically committed implicit transactions and internally executed transactions in TiDB. The maximum retry count of these transactions is determined by the value of `tidb_retry_limit`.

    For more details, see [limits of retry](/optimistic-transaction.md#limits-of-retry).

### tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 15
- This variable is used to set the concurrency of the `scan` operation.
- Use a bigger value in OLAP scenarios, and a smaller value in OLTP scenarios.
- For OLAP scenarios, the maximum value cannot exceed the number of CPU cores of all the TiKV nodes.
- If a table has a lot of partitions, you can reduce the variable value appropriately to avoid TiKV becoming out of memory (OOM).

### tidb_dml_batch_size

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 0
- When this value is greater than `0`, TiDB will batch commit statements such as `INSERT` or `LOAD DATA` into smaller transactions. This reduces memory usage and helps ensure that the `txn-total-size-limit` is not reached by bulk modifications.
- Only the value `0` provides ACID compliance. Setting this to any other value will break the atomicity and isolation guarantees of TiDB.

### tidb_enable_amend_pessimistic_txn <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0.7</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the `AMEND TRANSACTION` feature. If you enable the `AMEND TRANSACTION` feature in a pessimistic transaction, when concurrent DDL operations and SCHEMA VERSION changes exist on tables associated with this transaction, TiDB attempts to amend the transaction. TiDB corrects the transaction commit to make the commit consistent with the latest valid SCHEMA VERSION so that the transaction can be successfully committed without getting the `Information schema is changed` error. This feature is effective on the following concurrent DDL operations:

    - `ADD COLUMN` or `DROP COLUMN` operations.
    - `MODIFY COLUMN` or `CHANGE COLUMN` operations which increase the length of a field.
    - `ADD INDEX` or `DROP INDEX` operations in which the index column is created before the transaction is opened.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, this feature is incompatible with TiDB Binlog in some scenarios and might cause semantic changes on a transaction. For more usage precautions of this feature, refer to [Incompatibility issues about transaction semantic](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/21069) and [Incompatibility issues about TiDB Binlog](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/20996).

### tidb_enable_async_commit <span class="version-mark">New in v5.0.0-rc</span>

> **Warning:**
>
> Async commit is still an experimental feature. It is not recommended to use this feature in the production environment. Currently, the following incompatible issues are found, and be aware of them if you need to use this feature:

> - This feature is incompatible with [TiCDC](/ticdc/ticdc-overview.md) and might cause TiCDC to run abnormally.
> - This feature is incompatible with [Compaction Filter](/tikv-configuration-file.md#enable-compaction-filter-new-in-v500-rc). If you use the two features at the same time, write loss might occur.
> - This feature is incompatible with TiDB Binlog and does not take effect when TiDB Binlog is enabled.

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable controls whether to enable the async commit feature for the second phase of the two-phase transaction commit to perform asynchronously in the background. Enabling this feature can reduce the latency of transaction commit.

> **Warning:**
>
> When async commit is enabled, the external consistency of transactions cannot be guaranteed. For details, refer to [`tidb_guarantee_external_consistency`](#tidb_guarantee_external_consistency-new-in-v500-rc).

### tidb_enable_cascades_planner

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the cascades planner, which is currently considered experimental.

### tidb_enable_chunk_rpc <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: SESSION
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the `Chunk` data encoding format in Coprocessor.

### tidb_enable_clustered_index <span class="version-mark">New in v5.0.0-rc</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the [clustered index](/clustered-indexes.md) feature.
    - This feature is only applicable to newly created tables and does not affect the existing old tables.
    - This feature is only applicable to tables whose primary key is the single-column non-integer type or the multi-column type. It does not affect the tables without a primary key or tables with the primary key of the single-column integer type.
    - You can execute `select tidb_pk_type from information_schema.tables where table_name ='{table_name}'` to check whether the clustered index feature has been enabled on a table.
- After you enable this feature, rows are stored directly on the primary key instead of on the internally allocated `rows_id` to which the extra primary key index is created to point.

    This feature impacts performance in the following aspects:

    - For each `INSERT` operation, there is one less index key written into each row.
    - When you make a query using the primary key as the equivalent condition, one read request can be saved.
    - When you make a query using the primary key as the range condition, multiple read requests can be saved.
    - When you make a query using the prefix of the multi-column primary key as the equivalent condition or range condition, multiple read requests can be saved.

### tidb_enable_collect_execution_info

- Scope: INSTANCE
- Default value: ON
- This variable controls whether to record the execution information of each operator in the slow query log.

### tidb_enable_fast_analyze

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to set whether to enable the statistics `Fast Analyze` feature.
- If the statistics `Fast Analyze` feature is enabled, TiDB randomly samples about 10,000 rows of data as statistics. When the data is distributed unevenly or the data size is small, the statistics accuracy is low. This might lead to a non-optimal execution plan, for example, selecting a wrong index. If the execution time of the regular `Analyze` statement is acceptable, it is recommended to disable the `Fast Analyze` feature.

### tidb_enable_index_merge <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the index merge feature.

### tidb_enable_noop_functions <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- By default, TiDB returns an error when you attempt to use the syntax for functionality that is not yet implemented. When the variable value is set to `ON`, TiDB silently ignores such cases of unavailable functionality, which is helpful if you cannot make changes to the SQL code.
- Enabling `noop` functions controls the following behaviors:
    * `get_lock` and `release_lock` functions
    * `LOCK IN SHARE MODE` syntax
    * `SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS` syntax

> **Note:**
>
> Only the default value of `OFF` can be considered safe. Setting `tidb_enable_noop_functions=1` might lead to unexpected behaviors in your application, because it permits TiDB to ignore certain syntax without providing an error.

### tidb_enable_rate_limit_action

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: ON
- This variable controls whether to enable the dynamic memory control feature for the operator that reads data. By default, this operator enables the maximum number of threads that [`tidb_disql_scan_concurrency`](/system-variables.md#tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency) allows to read data. When the memory usage of a single SQL statement exceeds [`tidb_mem_quota_query`](/system-variables.md#tidb_mem_quota_query) each time, the operator that reads data stops one thread.
- When the operator that reads data has only one thread left and the memory usage of a single SQL statement continues to exceed [`tidb_mem_quota_query`](/system-variables.md#tidb_mem_quota_query), this SQL statement triggers other memory control behaviors, such as [spilling data to disk](/tidb-configuration-file.md#spilled-file-encryption-method).

### tidb_enable_slow_log

- Scope: INSTANCE
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the slow log feature.

### tidb_enable_stmt_summary <span class="version-mark">New in v3.0.4</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: ON (the value of the default configuration file)
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the statement summary feature. If enabled, SQL execution information like time consumption is recorded to the `information_schema.STATEMENTS_SUMMARY` system table to identify and troubleshoot SQL performance issues.

### tidb_enable_table_partition

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to set whether to enable the `TABLE PARTITION` feature:

    - `ON` indicates enabling Range partitioning, Hash partitioning, and Range column partitioning with one single column.
    - `AUTO` functions the same way as `ON` does.
    - `OFF` indicates disabling the `TABLE PARTITION` feature. In this case, the syntax that creates a partition table can be executed, but the table created is not a partitioned one.

### tidb_enable_telemetry <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0.2 version</span>

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to dynamically control whether the telemetry collection in TiDB is enabled. By setting the value to `OFF`, the telemetry collection is disabled. If the [`enable-telemetry`](/tidb-configuration-file.md#enable-telemetry-new-in-v402) TiDB configuration item is set to `false` on all TiDB instances, the telemetry collection is always disabled and this system variable will not take effect. See [Telemetry](/telemetry.md) for details.

### tidb_enable_vectorized_expression <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to control whether to enable vectorized execution.

### tidb_enable_window_function

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: ON
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the support for window functions. Note that window functions may use reserved keywords. This might cause SQL statements that could be executed normally cannot be parsed after upgrading TiDB. In this case, you can set `tidb_enable_window_function` to `OFF`.

### tidb_evolve_plan_baselines <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: OFF
- This variable is used to control whether to enable the baseline evolution feature. For detailed introduction or usage , see [Baseline Evolution](/sql-plan-management.md#baseline-evolution).
- To reduce the impact of baseline evolution on the cluster, use the following configurations:
    - Set `tidb_evolve_plan_task_max_time` to limit the maximum execution time of each execution plan. The default value is 600s.
    - Set `tidb_evolve_plan_task_start_time` and `tidb_evolve_plan_task_end_time` to limit the time window. The default values are respectively `00:00 +0000` and `23:59 +0000`.

### tidb_evolve_plan_task_end_time <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 23:59 +0000
- This variable is used to set the end time of baseline evolution in a day.

### tidb_evolve_plan_task_max_time <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 600
- This variable is used to limit the maximum execution time of each execution plan in the baseline evolution feature. The unit is second.

### tidb_evolve_plan_task_start_time <span class="version-mark">New in v4.0</span>

- Scope: GLOBAL
- Default value: 00:00 +0000
- This variable is used to set the start time of baseline evolution in a day.

### tidb_executor_concurrency <span class="version-mark">New in v5.0.0-rc</span>

- Scope: SESSION | GLOBAL
- Default value: 5

This variable is used to set the concurrency of the following SQL operators (to one value):

- `index lookup`
- `index lookup join`
- `hash join`
- `hash aggregation` (the `partial` and `final` phases)
- `window`
- `projection`

`tidb_executor_concurrency` incorporates the following existing system variables as a whole for easier management:

+ `tidb_index_lookup_concurrency`
+ `tidb_index_lookup_join_concurrency`
+ `tidb_hash_join_concurrency`
+ `tidb_hashagg_partial_concurrency`
+ `tidb_hashagg_final_concurrency`
+ `tidb_projection_concurrency`
+ `tidb_window_concurrency`

### Set Session variables

Add the `SESSION` keyword before the variable, use `@@session.` as the modifier, or use no modifier:

```sql
SET SESSION autocommit = 1;
SET @@session.autocommit = 1;
SET @@autocommit = 1;
```

> **Note:**
>
> `LOCAL` and `@@local.` are the synonyms for `SESSION` and `@@session.`

### The working mechanism of system variables

* Session variables will only initialize their own values based on global variables when a session is created. Changing a global variable does not change the value of the system variable being used by the session that has already been created.

    ```sql
    mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.autocommit;
    +---------------------+
    | @@GLOBAL.autocommit |
    +---------------------+
    | ON                  |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> SELECT @@SESSION.autocommit;
    +----------------------+
    | @@SESSION.autocommit |
    +----------------------+
    | ON                   |
    +----------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> SET GLOBAL autocommit = OFF;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

    mysql> SELECT @@SESSION.autocommit; -- Session variables do not change, and the transactions in the session are executed in the form of autocommit.
    +----------------------+
    | @@SESSION.autocommit |
    +----------------------+
    | ON                   |
    +----------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

    mysql> SELECT @@GLOBAL.autocommit;
    +---------------------+
    | @@GLOBAL.autocommit |
    +---------------------+
    | OFF                 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

## The fully supported MySQL system variables in TiDB

The following MySQL system variables are fully supported in TiDB and have the same behaviors as in MySQL.

| Name | Scope | Description |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| autocommit | GLOBAL \| SESSION | whether automatically commit a transaction|
| sql_mode | GLOBAL \| SESSION | support some of the MySQL SQL modes|
| time_zone | GLOBAL \| SESSION | the time zone of the database |
| tx_isolation | GLOBAL \| SESSION | the isolation level of a transaction |
| max\_execution\_time | GLOBAL \| SESSION | the execution timeout for a statement, in milliseconds |
| innodb\_lock\_wait\_timeout | GLOBAL \| SESSION | the lock wait time for pessimistic transactions, in seconds |
| interactive\_timeout | SESSION \| GLOBAL | the idle timeout of the interactive user session, in seconds   |

> **Note:**
>
> Unlike in MySQL, the `max_execution_time` system variable currently works on all kinds of statements in TiDB, not only restricted to the `SELECT` statement. The precision of the timeout value is roughly 100ms. This means the statement might not be terminated in accurate milliseconds as you specify.

## TiDB specific system variables

See [TiDB Specific System Variables](/tidb-specific-system-variables.md).
